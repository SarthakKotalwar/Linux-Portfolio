---
# Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

## Project Objectives
Phase 1 of this project focuses on the **foundational infrastructure setup**, ensuring all systems are ready for enterprise services.  

### Key Deliverables
- Installation and configuration of RHEL 9 virtual machines.
- Static IP networking across multiple servers.
- Logical Volume Manager (LVM) configuration for flexible storage management.
- Secure SSH access with key-based authentication.
- Preparation for service deployment in Phase 2.

---

## Infrastructure Overview
The project consists of **three RHEL 9 virtual machines** running in **VMware Workstation**, each serving a distinct role. Later in Phase 3, a 4th VM will be added and server as the Syslog Server.

| **VM**          | **Role**                 | **CPU** | **RAM** | **Disk** |
|---------------|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| `RHEL9-Primary` | Web & Database Server  | 2 vCPU | 4GB    | 30GB   |
| `RHEL9-Client`  | Test Client            | 1 vCPU | 2GB    | 15GB   |
| `RHEL9-Storage` | NFS                    | 2 vCPU | 2GB    | 20GB   |

---

### 1. Networking: Static IP Assignment
Each VM was assigned a static IP to ensure stable connectivity:

| **VM**          | **IP Address**  | **Subnet Mask**  | **Gateway** |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| `RHEL9-Primary` | `192.168.1.100` | `255.255.255.0` | `192.168.1.1` |
| `RHEL9-Client`  | `192.168.1.101` | `255.255.255.0` | `192.168.1.1` |
| `RHEL9-Storage` | `192.168.1.102` | `255.255.255.0` | `192.168.1.1` |

Configured using `nmtui`, then verified with:

```bash
ip a
ping -c 3 192.168.1.101  # Test connectivity
```

---

### 2. Storage: LVM-Based Disk Management
To for storage scalability, I configured **Logical Volume Manager (LVM).**

| **VM**          | **LVM Volume**  | **Size**  | **Purpose** |
|---------------|---------------|--------|------------|
| `RHEL9-Primary` | `rhel-root`  | 18.6G  | OS Filesystem |
| `RHEL9-Client`  | `rhel-root`  | 11.9G  | OS Filesystem |
| `RHEL9-Storage` | `rhel-root`  | 16.4G  | OS Filesystem |
| `RHEL9-Storage` | `lv_storage` | 5G     | Shared Storage |

Key LVM commands used:
```bash
lsblk  # Verify disk structure
lvcreate -L 5G -n lv_storage rhel 
mkfs.xfs /dev/rhel/lv_storage
mount /dev/rhel/lv_storage /mnt/storage
```

---

### 3. Secure SSH Access: Key-Based Authentication
To allow a secure, passwordless SSH login, I configured key-based authentication.

#### Steps Taken
1. **Generated SSH keys on `RHEL9-Primary`:**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   ```
2. **Copied keys to `RHEL9-Client` & `RHEL9-Storage`:**
   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id sysadmin@192.168.1.101
   ssh-copy-id sysadmin@192.168.1.102
   ```
3. **Verified login without password:**
   ```bash
   ssh sysadmin@192.168.1.101
   ssh sysadmin@192.168.1.102
   ```

If password prompts persisted, permissions were corrected as such:
```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### 3. NFS Shared Storage on TrueNAS

#### Steps Taken:
1. **Configured TrueNAS NFS share via Web Browser UI:**
   
  - Path: /mnt/nas-pool/backups
  - Allowed networks: 192.168.1.0/24
  - Enabled NFSv3 & NFSv4

   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nas-backups/client
   sudo chown -R sysadmin:sysadmin /mnt/nas-backups/ #### Permissions were preventing backups from taking place
   ```
2. **Scheduled automated backups via cron jobs**
   ```bash
    crontab -e
    0 11 * * * rsync -avz /etc/sysconfig sysadmin@192.168.1.102:/mnt/nas-backups/primary/ #### Runs daily backups at 11am
   ```
3. **Confirmed backup files were successfully transferred to the remote NAS server**

---

# Enterprise RHEL 9 Infrastructure Project
This phase focuses on **security hardening and automation**, providing a strong, secure, and manageable enterprise environment.

---
# Phase 3: Security Hardening & Automation
## Project Objectives
### Key Deliverables
- Configured Fail2Ban to prevent unauthorized SSH access.
- Implemented firewall rules to restrict network access.
- Enabled SELinux policies for enhanced security.
- Set up centralized logging with a dedicated logging server.
- Automated user account management with Ansible.
- Implemented system-wide updates and security configurations with Ansible playbooks.

---

## Infrastructure Overview
Phase 3 introduces a syslog server to provide a centralized location to collect and store system logs from various devices.

| **VM**            | **Role**                         | **CPU** | **RAM** | **Disk** |
|------------------|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| `logging-server` | Centralized Syslog Server         | 2 vCPU | 4GB    | 20GB   |

---
### 1. Fail2Ban: SSH Intrusion Prevention
Fail2Ban was installed to protect SSH from brute-force attacks. Since Fail2Ban isnâ€™t a dedicated RHEL product, needed to download the epel-release rpm in order to gain access to Fail2Ban.

#### Steps Taken
- **Installed Fail2Ban:**
  ```bash
  subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-9-$(arch)-rpms
  dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm
  sudo dnf install -y fail2ban
  ```
- **Configured SSH jail by modifying `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`:**
  ```bash
  [sshd]
  enabled = true
  port = ssh
  filter = sshd
  logpath = /var/log/secure
  maxretry = 5
  bantime = 600
  ```
- **Restarted the service and verified it was running:**
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable --now fail2ban
  sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
  ```

---

### 2. Firewall Hardening: Restricting Network Access
To ensure only necessary services are accessible, firewalld rules were enforced across all VMs. We added http,https,ssh, and nfs in our initial phase. So here I just wanted to verify those services were still accessible.

#### Verified settings:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
```
---
### 3. SELinux Enforcement
By default, SELinux is set to Enforcing. However, nothing beats actually verifying. In this environment, assuming could be a vulnerability on its own.

#### Steps Taken
- **Verified SELinux status:**
  ```bash
  sestatus
  ```
- **Applied SELinux policies for Apache,SSH & NFS:**
  ```bash
	sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on
	sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db on
	sudo setsebool -P nfs_export_all_rw on
	sudo setsebool -P ssh_chroot_rw_homedirs on
  ```
---

### 4. Centralized Logging
A new server, Logging Serer,was deployed to collect logs from all VMs.
I wanted to centralize the log data and isoloate the critical log data from potential disruptions on production servers.

#### Steps Taken
- **Configured `/etc/rsyslog.conf` on `logging-server`:**
  ```bash
  module(load="imudp")
  input(type="imudp" port="514")
  module(load="imtcp")
  input(type="imtcp" port="514")
  ```
- **Enabled log forwarding from all VMs:**
  ```bash
  echo "*.* @192.168.1.103:514" | sudo tee -a /etc/rsyslog.conf #192.168.1.103 = ip of Log Server
  sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
  ```
- **Verified log collection:**
  ```bash
  sudo tail -f /var/log/messages
  ```
---

### 5. Automating Security with Ansible. 
Ansible was used to automate user management, system updates, and security policies.
You can find all playbooks [here] (ansible-playbooks).

#### Ansible Playbooks Implemented

**Automated User Creation (`users.yml`):**
```yaml
---
- name: Create a new employee account
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  vars_prompt:
    - name: "new_user"
      prompt: "Enter the new employee's username"
      private: no

    - name: "new_password"
      prompt: "Enter a default password for the employee"
      private: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Create a new user
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: "{{ new_user }}"
        groups: allemployees
        shell: /bin/bash
        password: "{{ 'new_password' | password_hash('sha512') }}"

    - name: Force password change on first login
      ansible.builtin.command:
        cmd: "chage -d 0 {{ new_user }}"
```

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots
All screenshots of configurations & verifications for **Phase 3** are available [here](screenshots_phase2.md).

## Conclusion
This phase successfully implemented enterprise security hardening and automation across multiple RHEL 9 VMs:
- **Fail2Ban for SSH protection**
- **Firewall rules for network security**
- **SELinux for access control**
- **Centralized logging for system monitoring**
- **Ansible automation for user and system management**

This infrastructure is now hardened, automated, and production-ready.
